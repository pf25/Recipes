    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <h4>For the Cake:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat & Prepare:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking dish or a similar-sized pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter & Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs: </strong>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mix in Vanilla: </strong>Stir in the vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine: </strong>Gently fold in the flour mixture a little at a time until just blended.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow it to cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Tres Leches Mixture:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine Milks: </strong>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream (or whole milk) until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the Cake: </strong>Once the cake has cooled, use a fork to poke holes all over the surface of the cake. Slowly pour the milk mixture over the cake, ensuring the liquid is absorbed and the cake is fully saturated.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Topping:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Whip the Cream: </strong>In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. You can add a touch of sugar or vanilla extract for flavor, if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Top the Cake: </strong>Spread the whipped cream over the soaked cake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish: </strong>Optionally, sprinkle with a dusting of ground cinnamon. Decorate with fresh fruits or maraschino cherries as desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Refrigerate & Serve: </strong>efrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to soak up the milk mixture. Slice and serve chilled./li>
